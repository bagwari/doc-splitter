PDF Splitter (Node.js + Worker Threads)

High-performance Node.js utility to split a single combined PDF into multiple PDFs based on page → document type mapping, using Worker Threads for parallel processing.

Designed for scalability, performance, and production usage.

**Features**

Parallel PDF processing using Node.js worker threads

Splits PDFs by document type

Reads source PDF only once

⚡ Non-blocking, event-loop safe

📦 Prerequisites

Node.js 22.x+

npm 10+

node -v

Installation
git clone <repo-url>
cd pdf-splitter
npm install

**Input PDF**

Place your combined PDF here:

input/combined.pdf

**Page Mapping (pageMap.json)**

Defines which pages belong to which document type.

{
  "doctype1": [1, 2, ..],
  "doctype2": [3],
  "doctype3": [4, 5, 6,..]
}


**Notes:**

Pages are 1-based

Each key becomes an output PDF

Pages do not need to be contiguous

npm start

📂 Output

Generated PDFs appear in:

output/
